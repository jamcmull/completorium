30:2 In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: * deliver me in thy justice.
30:3 Bow down thy ear to me: * make haste to deliver me.
30:3 Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, * to save me.
30:4 For thou art my strength and my refuge; * and for thy name’s sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.
30:5 Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: * for thou art my protector.
30:6 Into thy hands I commend my spirit: * thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.
℣. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
℟. As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
